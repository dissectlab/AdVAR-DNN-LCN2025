# AdVAR-DNN-LCN2025

This repository contains the implementation for our paper  
**"AdVAR-DNN: Adversarial Variational Representation Attack on Distributed Neural Networks"**,  
accepted at **IEEE LCN 2025**.

The project investigates how adversarially modified intermediate features can affect  
distributed neural network inference. It includes scripts for feature extraction,  
VAE training, and generation of manipulated (adversarial) representations.
