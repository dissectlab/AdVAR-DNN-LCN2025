# AdVAR-DNN-LCN2025

This repository contains the implementation for our paper  
**"AdVAR-DNN: Adversarial Variational Representation Attack on Distributed Neural Networks"**,  
accepted at **IEEE LCN 2025**.

The project investigates how adversarially modified intermediate features can affect  
distributed neural network inference. It includes scripts for feature extraction,  
VAE training, and generation of manipulated (adversarial) representations.

------------------------
## üöÄ How to Run the Code

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.9 or newer and install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Extract intermediate features
This step uses the **retrained VGG19 model on CIFAR-100**, obtained through **transfer learning**.  
The model was fine-tuned on CIFAR-100 to adapt pretrained ImageNet features for this dataset.  
We extract intermediate feature maps from one of its convolutional layers (e.g., layer 20)  
to capture how the network internally represents image content.  

These feature representations are saved as `.pkl` files and later used to train the VAE,  
which generates the manipulated (adversarial) features analyzed in the paper.```bash
